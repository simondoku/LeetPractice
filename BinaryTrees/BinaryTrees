Consists of Nodes like a doubly linkedlist
But Pointers point down(left and right pointers)
Successive Nodes are know as child nodes of their successors
Leaf Nodes are Nodes that do not have any children
TopMost Nodes are known as root nodes
Cycles are not allowed in Binary Trees
Nodes that share the same parent are known as sibling nodes
Every node has to be connected to each other
The height of a single node is one
For a Node with the children, the height starts with that node till its lowest descendents

the height by the number of edges is n-1 where n is the number of nodes in the path from the root to the lowest leaf
the Depth is measure bottom up of the current node all the way up to the root node.

Binary Search Trees
This is like a binary tree but sorted
every single node on the left subtree must be less that every single node on the right subtree
There are no duplicates

Sorting allows for log(n) time which is more efficient that O(n)
